🌟 ***Intro :***

This project involves constructing an ETL pipeline using Apache AirFlow to alleviate congestion on national highways by analyzing road traffic data from various toll plazas. 
Each highway is operated by a different toll operator, utilizing distinct IT setups and file formats. 
The technologies used in this project include Shell scripting and Apache Airflow. The tasks performed are as follows:

✅  ***Tasks :***

Extracting data from a CSV file
Extracting data from a TSV file
Extracting data from a fixed-width file
Transforming the data
Loading the transformed data into the staging area




🚀🚀 **Each task was implemented using two approaches: BashOperator and PythonOperator**
